# Specialization Paths ðŸŽ¯

Once youâ€™ve got the basics down, you can pick a path based on what you want to do:

{% content-ref url="roadmap-path/frontend-with-flutter.md" %}
[frontend-with-flutter.md](roadmap-path/frontend-with-flutter.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="roadmap-path/backend-with-dart-frog/" %}
[backend-with-dart-frog](roadmap-path/backend-with-dart-frog/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
