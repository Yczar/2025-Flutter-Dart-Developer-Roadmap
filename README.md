Hi there! I am Czar 👋

Let me share a little story about how I got into Dart and how it’s shaped my journey over the years.

## 🌟 My Journey into Dart

Five years ago, I started exploring Dart out of curiosity. At the time, I was working with Java development a lot. While Java is a solid language,  I often found myself dealing with too much boilerplate code—all those extra lines you need to write just to get to the real work. It felt like a lot of effort and it was exhausting.

When I discovered Dart, it felt refreshing. ✨ The syntax was clean, there wasn’t as much boilerplate, and it just made things simpler. I quickly realized how easy it was to learn, especially compared to all of Java's boilerplate. With Dart, I could focus more on solving problems instead of getting bogged down by unnecessary details. That simplicity is what got me hooked.

As I learned more, I saw how flexible Dart was. 💡 It’s not just great for making mobile apps with Flutter—it’s also really solid for backend work, especially with frameworks like Dart Frog. Over the years, I’ve seen Dart grow and improve with every update, and it keeps getting better.

Now, in 2025, I wanted to put together this roadmap to help anyone interested in starting with Dart or improving their skills. This isn’t just a list of topics to learn; it’s a path based on what’s worked for me. Whether you want to build amazing user interfaces with Flutter or strong backend systems with Dart Frog, this roadmap will guide you. Let’s get started! 🚀
